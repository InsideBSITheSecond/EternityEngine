raytracing:
	ray marching since voxels
	=> ray march in compute shaders

voxel data to gpu:
	since we have packed meshes and the 2 matrices are mostly empty (identity)
	we can squeez some stuff in them like so:
	
		1 0 0 a
		0 1 0 b
		0 0 1 0
		x y z 1
	 xyz: projection * view * model
	 a: texure id
	 b: bitshifted chunk relative voxel coord
